# Shift-Add-Multiplier
A 10 bit shift/add multiplier described in VHDL. 


The subject of this specific project within the course "Design of Integrated Circuits II" is the construction of a circuit that will implement the multiplication operation between two 10-bit words using the Shift/Add technique. The implementation of the multiplier model through the VHDL language follows. The code that creates the requested multiplier has been divided into several stages for ease of understanding, the ability to intervene easily, and to facilitate the identification of possible errors.
